## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that **systematic investing (DCA) with appropriate risk management** can build substantial wealth over time. The choice of strategy significantly impacts both returns and volatility:

- **DCA strategies consistently outperformed** their lump sum counterparts
- **Leverage can enhance returns** but requires careful position sizing and risk management
- **Portfolio diversification** (90/10 strategy) offers an excellent balance of growth and risk control. **Adding just 10% of TQQQ to DCA portfolio provides similar risk/drawdowns as only DCA in QQQ (non-leveraged) while allowing for significanly greater upside.**
- **Long-term perspective** and disciplined execution are crucial for success
